# Hi! I'm Sharvil Misra!

I am an undergraduate student at Pennsylvania State University pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Applied Data Sciences. I am interested in data analytics, machine learning, and I am passionate about health and fitness!


This page is a work in progress, like me! Below are some projects I've done.

# [Project 1: Financial Crisis Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/sharvmisra/Finance-Data-Project) 
* Scraped stock information for six different banks from 2006-2016, then used Python libraries such as Pandas, numpy, and Seaborn to create plots and heatmaps of the banks stock returns. Analyzed this data to look for correlations between stocks, and which stocks had the best and worst single day returns. Also extracted statistics such as standard deviation to analyze stock risk.

# [Project 2: Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Machine Learning](https://github.com/sharvmisra/Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis-Using-Machine-Learning)
* Trained a decision tree-based model to automate the diagnosis of breast cancer. Modeled and tuned the parameters for overfitting reduction. Used stratified K-fold validation to get a training and testing accuracy of 95%.
